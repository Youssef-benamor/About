# 🚀 Career Readiness Checkpoint

## ✅ How Ready I Am

I feel confident and excited to begin the next chapter in my career as a **Full Stack Developer**. During the bootcamp, I built a solid foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, and I’m now ready to apply these skills in a professional environment.

I’ve learned how to build complete web applications from scratch, manage source code with Git and GitHub, work with APIs, and deploy projects using platforms like Vercel and Azure. I’m also comfortable collaborating on team projects using tools like Git branches, pull requests, and agile workflows.
